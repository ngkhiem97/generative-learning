# generative-learning

Generative learning is a branch of machine learning that involves training algorithms to generate new data that is similar to, but not identical to, the data used for training. Unlike discriminative learning, which focuses on classification tasks, generative learning aims to understand the underlying distribution of the data and use that knowledge to create new samples. Generative learning has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, and has the potential to revolutionize many industries by enabling machines to create new and innovative solutions to complex problems.
